Ansible Role - Desktop
=========

A simple role to help quickly configure a new desktop or laptop from a clean Ubuntu state.

## DISCLAIMER
This role was intended to be **as fast as possible** and not to be easily customized for re-use by others. This is the reason why it has not been split into many individual roles per component. This role is best suited for gbolo :)
